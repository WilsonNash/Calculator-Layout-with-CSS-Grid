# Calculator-Layout-with-CSS-Grid

I built this really simple calculator and laid everything out using CSS Grid so that I could start familarizing myself with this upcoming CSS feature. I didn't spend a lot of time tweaking the code for the calculator, but it works normally for the most part. My main focus here was just playing with CSS Grid.

This is the example code for a blog post I made over at my site, [wilsonnashdesign.com]
